# Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE) for PyTorch

This repository contains an educational implementation of Rotary Positional Encodings (RoPE) in PyTorch. RoPE is a method introduced in the paper [RoFormer: Enhanced Transformer with Rotary Position Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09864) by Jianlin Su, Yu Lu, Shengfeng Pan, Ahmed Murtadha, Bo Wen, and Yunfeng Liu.

## Overview

RoPE is a technique to incorporate positional information into the transformer architecture, specifically for self-attention mechanisms. It combines absolute and relative position information using rotation matrices, enabling the model to learn both local and global dependencies effectively.

## Implementation

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of the Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE) method. RoPE is a novel technique for positional encoding in transformers that unifies absolute and relative approaches.
